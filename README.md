# RnS Seedy

A tool to figure out what seed you're on in Rabbit and Steel. Currently only supports Hard/Lunar runs because of RNG
related details.

## Local Development

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

The current adapter is set up to be statically hosted over GitHub Pages.
